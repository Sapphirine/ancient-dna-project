      <h1>Genetics of Lactose Intolerance</h1>
      <p>
        Onwards! You now should have a good understanding of how lactose
        intolerance works and its underlying genetics. Now we will dive deeper
        into the genetics by using a genome browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        A genome browser is a tool that allows you to study a reference genome
        (a representative DNA sequence of some group of organisms) and
        deviations from the reference genome. One example of a deviation is a
        single nucleotide deviation, called a SNP (single nucleotide
        polymorphism) or SNV (single nucleotide variation). Consider the single
        nucleotide difference that resulted in some Europeans having lactase
        persistence (T instead of C). Using the genome explorer below, you will
        see that C is the nucleotide in the reference genome and T is a
        deviation - the deviation forms a SNP (in particular, named rs4988235)!

        Click on the below image to open the UCSC Lactase Persistence article
        (it will open in another tab). Read through the article and click on
        embedded links to open up the UCSC genome browser to explore yourself.
        As you read, keep in mind the following questions.
