      <h1>Understanding Lactose Intolerance With Ancient DNA</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to our website! Do you or anyone you know of have the condition
        of lactose intolerance - the condition where drinking milk causes
        bloating or diarrhea? Why is it that some people have the condition and
        some people do not? Today, we will be taking an exciting journey to
        answer this question using ancient DNA. Hope you have fun!
      </p>
      <p>
        Start by watching the "The Evolution of Lactose Intolerance" video
        below. As you watch, keep in mind the following questions. Watch the
        video and try to answer the questions yourself before clicking on them
        to reveal the answers.

              Lactose intolerance occurs when a person consumes a lactose
              containing product (such as milk) even though their body does not
              produce sufficient amounts of lactase, an enzyme that breaks down
              lactose so it can be digested. Undigested lactose enters the large
              intestine and starts to be consumed by bacteria, resulting in
              symptoms such as diarrhea and gas.

              Single nucleotide differences outside of the lactase gene regulate
              the gene. These differences results in people becoming lactase
              persistent, meaning their ability to produce lactase persists
              beyond childhood. In Europeans, there exists a single nucleotide
              difference (T instead of a C). In the Massai population of Africa,
              the single nuclotide difference is a C instead of a G.

              Some advantages are as follows:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Milk reduces exposure to pathogens, due to milk being a
                  relatively uncontaminated food.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Milk helps a person maintain their health, due to milk's being
                  protein and fat rich.
                </li>
                <li>Milk may be the only food available during a famine.</li>
