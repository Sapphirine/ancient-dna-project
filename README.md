Our repository is structured into two folders, Data and Website. "Data" includes the code needed to construct the `ancientHumanData.json` file. "Website" includes all the code needed to run our website.

To run the website yourself, follow the following instructions:

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the `Website/lactoseIntoleranceProj` directory
3. Run `npm install` to install all libraries (download Node.Js if you haven't already)
4. Run `npm run devStart`
5. The website should start up on `localhost:5000`
